> You have to read some basic definitions and code samples of socket to finish this tiny task!
  It's kanda interesting when you experience the whole procedure.

  If you familiar with the socket, you will save a lot of time on it.

  This problem is mainly about the path of some files which I change the absolute path.

>For real? : (
For me, I think it's quite hard to start since it's a "big" project with excellent structure.
So I read some blogs about it which mainly about the private parameter and the function - **"Write()"**

And I have to admit that it's different with my former work which makes me thrilled! : )

* 12.26: Accomplishing the 'Write'-related functions.

* 12.27: Accomplishing the 'Read'-related functions.

* **Check**:

Finally, I finish this lab!

But there are still many problem in my code here!

* `_read_count += len` 's Position

    Up to now, I think it's related to the module which that code belong to.

* `peek_output()`

    I don't understand the reason why the online code can be simplified like that.

    It's seem like my code is more logical? : ) Actually, I don't know at all.
